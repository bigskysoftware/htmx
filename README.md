## introduction

htmx allows you to access  [AJAX](https://htmx.org/docs#ajax), [CSS Transitions](https://htmx.org/docs#css_transitions),
[WebSockets](https://htmx.org/docs#websockets) and [Server Sent Events](https://htmx.org/docs#sse)
directly in HTML, using [attributes](https://htmx.org/reference#attributes), so you can build
[modern user interfaces](https://htmx.org/examples) with the [simplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) and
[power](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) of hypertext

htmx is small ([~14k min.gz'd](https://unpkg.com/htmx.org/dist/)),
[dependency-free](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/master/package.json) &
[extendable](https://htmx.org/extensions)

## motivation

* Why should only `<a>` and `<form>` be able to make HTTP requests?
* Why should only `click` & `submit` events trigger them?
* Why should only GET & POST be available?
* Why should you only be able to replace the *entire* screen?

By removing these arbitrary constraints htmx completes HTML as a
[hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext)

## quick start

```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.4"></script>
  <!-- have a button POST a click via AJAX -->
  <button hx-post="/clicked" hx-swap="outerHTML">
    Click Me
  </button>
```

The [`hx-post`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-post) and [`hx-swap`](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap) attributes tell htmx:

> "When a user clicks on this button, issue an AJAX request to /clicked, and replace the entire button with the response"

htmx is the successor to [intercooler.js](http://intercoolerjs.org)

### installing as a node package

To install using npm:

```
npm install htmx.org --save
```

Note there is an old broken package called `htmx`.  This is `htmx.org`.

### hacking guide

To develop htmx locally, you will need to install the development dependencies.

Run:

```
npm install
```

Then, run a web server in the root.

This is easiest with:

```
npx serve
```

You can then run the test suite by navigating to:

<http://0.0.0.0:3000/test/>

At this point you can modify `/src/htmx.js` to add features, and then add tests in the appropriate area under `/test`.

* `/test/index.html` - the root test page from which all other tests are included
* `/test/attributes` - attribute specific tests
* `/test/core` - core functionality tests
* `/test/core/regressions.js` - regression tests
* `/test/ext` - extension tests
* `/test/manual` - manual tests that cannot be automated

htmx uses the [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework, the [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertion framework
and [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/releases/v9/fake-xhr-and-server/) to mock out AJAX requests.  They are all OK.

You can also run live tests and demo of the WebSockets and Server-Side Events extensions with `npm run ws-tests`

*javascript fatigue:<br/>
longing for a hypertext<br/>
