# Why Are These Files Here?

These are legacy extensions for htmx 1.x and are **NOT** actively maintained or guaranteed to work with htmx 2.x.
They are here because we unfortunately linked to unversioned unpkg URLs in the installation guides for them
in 1.x, so we need to keep them here to preserve those URLs and not break existing users functionality.

If you are looking for extensions for htmx 2.x, please see the [htmx 2.0 extensions site](https://htmx.org/extensions), 
which has links to the new extensions repos (They have all been moved to their own NPM projects and URLs, like
they should have been from the start!)
