[Idiomorph](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph) is a DOM morphing algorithm created by the htmx creator.  DOM
morphing is a process where an existing DOM tree is "morphed" into the shape of another in a way that resuses as much of
the existing DOM's nodes as possible.  By preserving nodes when changing from one tree to another you can present a 
much smoother transition between the two states.

You can use the idiomorph morphing algorith as a [swapping](@attributes/hx-swap) strategy by including the idiomorph 
extension.

## Install

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/idiomorph@0.3.0/dist/idiomorph-ext.min.js"></script>
```

### Via Module Import

```javascript
import "idiomorph/htmx";
```

## Usage

Once you have referenced the idiomorph extension, you can register it with the name `morph` on the body and then being
using `morph`, `morph:outerHTML` or `morph:innerHTML` as swap strategies.

* `morph` & `morph:outerHTML` will morph the target element as well as it's children
* `morph:innerHTML` will morph only the inner children of an element, leaving the target untouched

```html
<body hx-ext="morph">

    <button hx-get="/example" hx-swap="morph">
        Morph My Outer HTML
    </button>

    <button hx-get="/example" hx-swap="morph:outerHTML">
        Morph My Outer HTML
    </button>
    
    <button hx-get="/example" hx-swap="morph:innerHTML">
        Morph My Inner HTML
    </button>

</body>
```
