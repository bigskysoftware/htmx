title = "htmx Head Tag Support Extension"
+++

The `head-support` extension adds support for [head tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head)
in responses to htmx requests.

htmx began as a library focused on _partial replacement_ of HTML within the `body` tag.  As such, merging additional
information such as the head tag was not a focus of the library.  (This is in contrast with, for example, TurboLinks,
which was focused on merging entire web pages retrieved via AJAX into the browser.)

The [`hx-boost`](@/attributes/hx-boost.md) attribute moved htmx closer to this world of full HTML-document support &
support for extracting the `title` tag out of head elements was eventually added, but full head tag support has never been
a feature of the library.  This extension addresses that shortcoming.

## Installing

The fastest way to install `head-support` is to load it via a CDN. Remember to always include the core htmx library before the extension and [enable the extension](#usage).
```HTML
<head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.4" integrity="sha384-HGfztofotfshcF7+8n44JQL2oJmowVChPTg48S+jvZoztPfvwD79OC/LTtG6dMp+" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx-ext-head-support@2.0.2" integrity="sha384-cvMqHzjCJsOHgGuyB3sWXaUSv/Krm0BdzjuI1rtkjCbL1l1oHJx+cHyVRJhyuEz0" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</head>
<body hx-ext="head-support">
...
```
An unminified version is also available at https://unpkg.com/htmx-ext-head-support/dist/head-support.js.

While the CDN approach is simple, you may want to consider [not using CDNs in production](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/why-not-javascript-cdn). The next easiest way to install `head-support` is to simply copy it into your project. Download the extension from `https://unpkg.com/htmx-ext-head-support`, add it to the appropriate directory in your project and include it where necessary with a `<script>` tag.

For npm-style build systems, you can install `head-support` via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):
```shell
npm install htmx-ext-head-support
```
After installing, you'll need to use appropriate tooling to bundle `node_modules/htmx-ext-head-support/dist/head-support.js` (or `.min.js`). For example, you might bundle the extension with htmx core from `node_modules/htmx.org/dist/htmx.js` and project-specific code.

If you are using a bundler to manage your javascript (e.g. Webpack, Rollup):
- Install `htmx.org` and `htmx-ext-head-support` via npm
- Import both packages to your `index.js`
```JS
import `htmx.org`;
import `htmx-ext-head-support`; 
```

## Usage

```html
<body hx-ext="head-support">
...
</body>
```

With this installed, all responses that htmx receives that contain a `head` tag in them (even if they are not complete
HTML documents with a root `<html>` element) will be processed.

How the head tag is handled depends on the type of htmx request.

If the htmx request is from a boosted element, then the following merge algorithm is used:

* Elements that exist in the current head as exact textual matches will be left in place
* Elements that do not exist in the current head will be added at the end of the head tag
* Elements that exist in the current head, but not in the new head will be removed from the head

If the htmx request is from a non-boosted element, then all content will be _appended_ to the existing head element.

If you wish to override this behavior in either case, you can place the `hx-head` attribute on the new `<head>` tag,
with either of the following two values:

* `merge` - follow the merging algorithm outlined above
* `append` - append the elements to the existing head

### Controlling Merge Behavior

Beyond this, you may also control merging behavior of individual elements with the following attributes:

* If you place `hx-head="re-eval"` on a head element, it will be re-added (removed and appended) to the head tag on every
request, even if it already exists.  This can be useful to execute a script on every htmx request, for example.
* If you place `hx-preserve="true"` on an element, it will never be removed from the head

### Example

As an example, consider the following head tag in an existing document:

```html
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://the.missing.style">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/site1.css">
<script src="/js/script1.js"></script>
<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>
</head>
```

If htmx receives a request containing this new head tag:

```html
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://the.missing.style">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/site2.css">
<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>
<script src="/js/script3.js"></script>
</head>
```

Then the following operations will occur:

* `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://the.missing.style">` will be left alone
* `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/site1.css">` will be removed from the head
* `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/site2.css">` will be added to the head
* `<script src="/js/script1.js"></script>` will be removed from the head
* `<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>` will be left alone
* `<script src="/js/script3.js"></script>` will be added to the head

The final head element will look like this:

```html
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://the.missing.style">
<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/site2.css">
<script src="/js/script3.js"></script>
</head>
```

## Events

This extension triggers the following events:

* `htmx:removingHeadElement` - triggered when a head element is about to be removed, with the element being removed
available in `event.detail.headElement`.  If `preventDefault()` is invoked on the event, the element will not be removed.
* `htmx:addingHeadElement` - triggered when a head element is about to be added, with the element being added
available in `event.detail.headElement`.  If `preventDefault()` is invoked on the event, the element will not be added.
* `htmx:afterHeadMerge` - triggered after a head tag merge has occurred, with the following values available in the event `detail`:
* `added` - added head elements
* `kept` -  kept head elements
* `removed` -  removed head elements
* `htmx:beforeHeadMerge` - triggered before a head merge occurs
