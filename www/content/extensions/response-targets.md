This extension allows you to specify different target elements to be swapped when
different HTTP response codes are received.

It uses attribute names in a form of ``hx-target-[CODE]`` where `[CODE]` is a numeric
HTTP response code with the optional wildcard character at its end. You can also use
`hx-target-error`, which handles both 4xx and 5xx response codes.

The value of each attribute can be:

* A CSS query selector of the element to target.
* `this` which indicates that the element that the `hx-target` attribute is on is the target.
* `closest <CSS selector>` which will find the closest parent ancestor that matches the given CSS selector
(e.g. `closest tr` will target the closest table row to the element).
* `find <CSS selector>` which will find the first child descendant element that matches the given CSS selector.
* `next <CSS selector>` which will scan the DOM forward for the first element that matches the given CSS selector.
(e.g. `next .error` will target the closest following sibling element with `error` class)
* `previous <CSS selector>` which will scan the DOM backwards for the first element that matches the given CSS selector.
(e.g `previous .error` will target the closest previous sibling with `error` class)

## Installing

The fastest way to install `response-targets` is to load it via a CDN. Remember to always include the core htmx library before the extension and [enable the extension](#usage).
```HTML
<head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.4" integrity="sha384-HGfztofotfshcF7+8n44JQL2oJmowVChPTg48S+jvZoztPfvwD79OC/LTtG6dMp+" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx-ext-response-targets@2.0.2" integrity="sha384-T41oglUPvXLGBVyRdZsVRxNWnOOqCynaPubjUVjxhsjFTKrFJGEMm3/0KGmNQ+Pg" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</head>
<body hx-ext="response-targets">
...
```
An unminified version is also available at https://unpkg.com/htmx-ext-response-targets/dist/response-targets.js.

While the CDN approach is simple, you may want to consider [not using CDNs in production](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/why-not-javascript-cdn). The next easiest way to install `response-targets` is to simply copy it into your project. Download the extension from `https://unpkg.com/htmx-ext-response-targets`, add it to the appropriate directory in your project and include it where necessary with a `<script>` tag.

For npm-style build systems, you can install `response-targets` via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):
```shell
npm install htmx-ext-response-targets
```
After installing, you'll need to use appropriate tooling to bundle `node_modules/htmx-ext-response-targets/dist/response-targets.js` (or `.min.js`). For example, you might bundle the extension with htmx core from `node_modules/htmx.org/dist/htmx.js` and project-specific code.

If you are using a bundler to manage your javascript (e.g. Webpack, Rollup):
- Install `htmx.org` and `htmx-ext-response-targets` via npm
- Import both packages to your `index.js`
```JS
import `htmx.org`;
import `htmx-ext-response-targets`; 
```

## Configure (optional)

* When `HX-Retarget` response header is received it disables any lookup that would be
performed by this extension but any responses with error status codes will be
swapped (normally they would not be, even with target set via header) and internal
error flag (`isError`) will be modified. You may change this and choose to ignore
`HX-Retarget` header when `hx-target-…` is in place by setting a configuration flag
`htmx.config.responseTargetPrefersRetargetHeader` to `false` (default is
`true`). Note that this extension only performs a simple check whether the header
is set and target exists. It is not extracting target's value from the header but
trusts it was set by HTMX core logic.

* Normally, any target which is already established by HTMX built-in functions or
extensions called before will be overwritten if a matching `hx-target-…` tag is
found. You may change it by using a configuration flag
`htmx.config.responseTargetPrefersExisting` to `true` (default is `false`). This is
kinky and risky option. It has a real-life applications similar to a skilled,
full-stack tardigrade eating parentheses when no one is watching.

* `isError` flag on the `detail` member of an event associated with swapping the
content with `hx-target-[CODE]` will be set to `false` when error response code is
received. This is different from the default behavior. You may change this by
setting a configuration flag `htmx.config.responseTargetUnsetsError` to `false`
(default is `true`).

* `isError` flag on the `detail` member of an event associated with swapping the
content with `hx-target-[CODE]` will be set to `false` when non-erroneous response
code is received. This is no different from the default behavior. You may change
this by setting a configuration flag `htmx.config.responseTargetSetsError` to
`true` (default is `false`). This setting will not affect the response code 200
since it is not handled by this extension.

## Usage

Here is an example that targets a `div` for normal (200) response but another `div`
for 404 (not found) response, and yet another for all 5xx response codes:

```html
<div hx-ext="response-targets">
<div id="response-div"></div>
<button hx-post="/register"
hx-target="#response-div"
hx-target-5*="#serious-errors"
hx-target-404="#not-found">
Register!
</button>
<div id="serious-errors"></div>
<div id="not-found"></div>
</div>
```

* The response from the `/register` URL will replace contents of the `div` with the
`id` `response-div` when response code is 200 (OK).

* The response from the `/register` URL will replace contents of the `div` with the `id`
`serious-errors` when response code begins with a digit 5 (server errors).

* The response from the `/register` URL will replace contents of the `div` with
the `id` `not-found` when response code is 404 (Not Found).

Sometimes you may not want to handle 5xx and 4xx errors separately, in which case you
can use `hx-target-error`:

```html
<div hx-ext="response-targets">
<div id="response-div"></div>
<button hx-post="/register"
hx-target="#response-div"
hx-target-error="#any-errors">
Register!
</button>
<div id="any-errors"></div>
</div>
```

2xx codes will be handled as in the previous example. However, when the response code is 5xx
or 4xx, the response from `/register` will replace the contents of the `div` with the `id`
`any-errors`.

## Wildcard resolution

When status response code does not match existing `hx-target-[CODE]` attribute name
then its numeric part expressed as a string is trimmed with last character being
replaced with the asterisk (`*`). This lookup process continues until the attribute
is found or there are no more digits.

For example, if a browser receives 404 error code, the following attribute names will
be looked up (in the given order):

* `hx-target-404`
* `hx-target-40*`
* `hx-target-4*`
* `hx-target-*`.


_If you are using tools that do not support asterisks in HTML attributes, you
may instead use the `x` character, e.g., `hx-target-4xx`._

## Notes

* `hx-target-…` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element.
* `hx-target-…` cannot be used to handle HTTP response code 200.
* `hx-target-…` will honor `HX-Retarget` by default and will prefer it over any
calculated target but it can be changed by disabling the
`htmx.config.responseTargetPrefersRetargetHeader` configuration option.
* To avoid surprises the `hx-ext` attribute used to enable this extension should be
placed on a parent element containing elements with `hx-target-…` and `hx-target`
attributes.
