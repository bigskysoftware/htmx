# Examples Directory

Files here are **implementation examples**, not atomic patterns.

## Why files were moved here

Some files previously in `/patterns` are actually full implementations rather than single, atomic behaviors. They've been moved here to separate:

- **Patterns** (`/patterns`) = Single concept, reusable behavior
- **Examples** (`/examples`) = Complete implementation combining patterns

Examples will be featured in the interactive playground on the homepage.
