### Demo

Note that the video kept playing, despite the fact it is now a child of a `figure` element.  And you can click back
and the video should continue to work as well.  I enjoy flipping back and forth.

#### Background

Rickrolling or a Rickroll is an Internet meme involving the unexpected appearance of the music video to the 1987 hit
song "Never Gonna Give You Up", performed by English singer Rick Astley. The aforementioned video has over 1.5 billion
views on YouTube. The meme is a type of bait and switch, usually using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the music
video. When one clicks on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with the music video loads instead of what was expected,
and they have been "Rickrolled". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics, or singing it, in unexpected
contexts. Astley himself has also been Rickrolled on several occasions.

The meme grew out of a similar bait-and-switch trick called "duck rolling" that was popular on the 4chan website in
2006. The video bait-and-switch trick grew popular on 4chan by 2007 during April Fools' Day and spread to other Internet
sites later that year. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several publicised events, particularly when
YouTube used it on its 2008 April Fools' Day event.

Astley, who had only returned to performing after a 10-year hiatus, was initially hesitant about using his newfound
popularity from the meme to further his career but accepted the fame by Rickrolling the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade with a surprise performance of the song. Since then, Astley has seen his performance career revitalized by the
meme's popularity, and Rickrolling saw a massive resurgence online in the early 2020s.
