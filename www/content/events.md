Htmx provides an extensive events system that can be used to modify and enhance behavior.  Events
are listed below.

### Event - `htmx:abort` {#htmx:abort}

This event is different than other events: htmx does not *trigger* it, but rather *listens* for it.

If you send an `htmx:abort` event to an element making a request, it will abort the request:

```html
<button id="request-button" hx-post="/example">Issue Request</button>
<button onclick="htmx.trigger('#request-button', 'htmx:abort')">Cancel Request</button>
```

### Event - `htmx:afterOnLoad` {#htmx:afterOnLoad}

This event is triggered after an AJAX `onload` has finished.  Note that this does not mean that the content
has been swapped or settled yet, only that the request has finished.

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the element that dispatched the request or if the body no longer contains the element then the closest parent
* `detail.xhr` - the `XMLHttpRequest`
* `detail.target` - the target of the request
* `detail.requestConfig` - the configuration of the AJAX request

### Event - `htmx:afterProcessNode` {#htmx:afterProcessNode}

This event is triggered after htmx has initialized a DOM node.  It can be useful for extensions to build additional features onto a node.

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the element being initialized

### Event - `htmx:afterRequest` {#htmx:afterRequest}

This event is triggered after an AJAX request has finished either in the case of a successful request (although
one that may have returned a remote error code such as a `404`) or in a network error situation.  This event
can be paired with [`htmx:beforeRequest`](#htmx:beforeRequest) to wrap behavior around a request cycle.

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the element that dispatched the request or if the body no longer contains the element then the closest parent
* `detail.xhr` - the `XMLHttpRequest`
* `detail.target` - the target of the request
* `detail.requestConfig` - the configuration of the AJAX request
* `detail.successful` - true if the response has a 20x status code or is marked `detail.isError = false` in the
  `htmx:beforeSwap` event, else false
* `detail.failed` - true if the response does not have a 20x status code or is marked `detail.isError = true` in the
  `htmx:beforeSwap` event, else false

### Event - `htmx:afterSettle` {#htmx:afterSettle}

This event is triggered after the DOM has [settled](@/docs.md#request-operations).

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the updated element
* `detail.xhr` - the `XMLHttpRequest`
* `detail.target` - the target of the request
* `detail.requestConfig` - the configuration of the AJAX request

### Event - `htmx:afterSwap` {#htmx:afterSwap}

This event is triggered after new content has been [swapped into the DOM](@/docs.md#swapping).

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the swapped in element
* `detail.xhr` - the `XMLHttpRequest`
* `detail.target` - the target of the request
* `detail.requestConfig` - the configuration of the AJAX request

### Event - `htmx:beforeCleanupElement` {#htmx:beforeCleanupElement}

This event is triggered before htmx [disables](@/attributes/hx-disable.md) an element or removes it from the DOM.

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the element to be cleaned up

### Event - `htmx:beforeOnLoad` {#htmx:beforeOnLoad}

This event is triggered before any response processing occurs.  If you call `preventDefault()` on the event to cancel it, no swap will occur.

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the element that dispatched the request
* `detail.xhr` - the `XMLHttpRequest`
* `detail.target` - the target of the request
* `detail.requestConfig` - the configuration of the AJAX request

### Event - `htmx:beforeProcessNode` {#htmx:beforeProcessNode}

This event is triggered before htmx initializes a DOM node and has processed all of its `hx-` attributes.  This gives extensions and other external code the ability to modify the contents of a DOM node before it is processed.

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the element being initialized

### Event - `htmx:beforeRequest` {#htmx:beforeRequest}

This event is triggered before an AJAX request is issued.  If you call `preventDefault()` on the event to cancel it, no request will occur.

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the element that dispatched the request
* `detail.xhr` - the `XMLHttpRequest`
* `detail.target` - the target of the request
* `detail.requestConfig` - the configuration of the AJAX request

### Event - `htmx:beforeSend` {#htmx:beforeSend}

This event is triggered right before a request is sent.  You may not cancel the request with this event.

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the element that dispatched the request
* `detail.xhr` - the `XMLHttpRequest`
* `detail.target` - the target of the request
* `detail.requestConfig` - the configuration of the AJAX request

### Event - `htmx:beforeSwap` {#htmx:beforeSwap}

This event is triggered before any new content has been [swapped into the DOM](@/docs.md#swapping).
Most values on `detail` can be set to override subsequent behavior, other than where response headers take precedence.
If you call `preventDefault()` on the event to cancel it, no swap will occur.

You can modify the default swap behavior by modifying the `shouldSwap`, `selectOverride`, `swapOverride` and `target` properties of the event detail.
See the documentation on [configuring swapping](@/docs.md#modifying_swapping_behavior_with_events) for more details.

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the target of the swap
* `detail.xhr` - the `XMLHttpRequest`
* `detail.requestConfig` - the configuration of the AJAX request
* `detail.requestConfig.elt` - the element that dispatched the request
* `detail.shouldSwap` - if the content will be swapped (defaults to `false` for non-200 response codes)
* `detail.ignoreTitle` - if `true` any title tag in the response will be ignored
* `detail.isError` - whether error events should be triggered and also determines the values of `detail.successful` and `detail.failed` in later events
* `detail.serverResponse` - the server response as text to be used for the swap
* `detail.selectOverride` - add this to use instead of an [`hx-select`](@/attributes/hx-select.md) value
* `detail.swapOverride` - add this to use instead of an [`hx-swap`](@/attributes/hx-swap.md) value
* `detail.target` - the target of the swap

### Event - `htmx:beforeTransition` {#htmx:beforeTransition}

This event is triggered before a [View Transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) 
wrapped swap occurs.  If you call `preventDefault()` on the event to cancel it, the View Transition will not occur and the normal swapping logic will
happen instead.

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the element that dispatched the request
* `detail.xhr` - the `XMLHttpRequest`
* `detail.requestConfig` - the configuration of the AJAX request
* `detail.shouldSwap` - if the content will be swapped (defaults to `false` for non-200 response codes)
* `detail.target` - the target of the swap

### Event - `htmx:configRequest` {#htmx:configRequest}

This event is triggered after htmx has collected parameters for inclusion in the request.  It can be
used to include or update the parameters that htmx will send:

```javascript
document.body.addEventListener('htmx:configRequest', function(evt) {
    evt.detail.parameters['auth_token'] = getAuthToken(); // add a new parameter into the mix
});
```

Note that if an input value appears more than once the value in the `parameters` object will be an array, rather
than a single value.

##### Details

* `detail.parameters` - the parameters that will be submitted in the request
* `detail.unfilteredParameters` - the parameters that were found before filtering by [`hx-params`](@/attributes/hx-params.md)
* `detail.headers` - the request headers
* `detail.elt` - the element that triggered the request
* `detail.target` - the target of the request
* `detail.verb` - the HTTP verb in use

### Event - `htmx:confirm` {#htmx:confirm}

This event is fired on every trigger for a request (not just on elements that have a hx-confirm attribute).
It allows you to cancel (or delay) issuing the AJAX request.
If you call `preventDefault()` on the event, it will not issue the given request.
The `detail` object contains a function, `evt.detail.issueRequest(skipConfirmation=false)`, that can be used to issue the actual AJAX request at a later point.
Combining these two features allows you to create an asynchronous confirmation dialog.

Here is a basic example that shows the basic usage of the `htmx:confirm` event without altering the default behavior:

```javascript
document.body.addEventListener('htmx:confirm', function(evt) {
  // 0. To modify the behavior only for elements with the hx-confirm attribute,
  //    check if evt.detail.target.hasAttribute('hx-confirm')

  // 1. Prevent the default behavior (this will prevent the request from being issued)
  evt.preventDefault();
  
  // 2. Do your own logic here
  console.log(evt.detail)

  // 3. Manually issue the request when you are ready
  evt.detail.issueRequest(); // or evt.detail.issueRequest(true) to skip the built-in window.confirm()
});
```

And here is an example using [sweet alert](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/) on any element with a `confirm-with-sweet-alert="{question}"` attribute on it:

```javascript
document.body.addEventListener('htmx:confirm', function(evt) {
  // 1. The requirement to show the sweet alert is that the element has a confirm-with-sweet-alert
  //    attribute on it, if it doesn't we can return early and let the default behavior happen
  if (!evt.detail.target.hasAttribute('confirm-with-sweet-alert')) return

  // 2. Get the question from the attribute
  const question = evt.detail.target.getAttribute('confirm-with-sweet-alert');

  // 3. Prevent the default behavior (this will prevent the request from being issued)
  evt.preventDefault();

  // 4. Show the sweet alert
  swal({
    title: "Are you sure?",
    text: question || "Are you sure you want to continue?",
    icon: "warning",
    buttons: true,
    dangerMode: true,
  }).then((confirmed) => {
    if (confirmed) {
      // 5. If the user confirms, we can manually issue the request
      evt.detail.issueRequest(true); // true to skip the built-in window.confirm()
    }
  });
});
```

##### Details

* `detail.elt` - the element in question
* `detail.etc` - additional request information (mostly unused)
* `detail.issueRequest(skipConfirmation=false)` - a function that can be invoked to issue the request (should be paired with `evt.preventDefault()`!), if skipConfirmation is `true` the original `window.confirm()` is not executed
* `detail.path` - the path of the request
* `detail.target` - the element that triggered the request
* `detail.triggeringEvent` - the original event that triggered this request
* `detail.verb` - the verb of the request (e.g. `GET`)
* `detail.question` - the question passed to `hx-confirm` attribute (only available if `hx-confirm` attribute is present)
