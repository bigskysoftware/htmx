  The hx-swap attribute in htmx allows you to specify the 'swap strategy', or how the response will be swapped in \
  relative to the target of an AJAX request. The default swap strategy is `innerHTML`."""
+++

The `hx-swap` attribute allows you to specify how the response will be swapped in relative to the
[target](@/attributes/hx-target.md) of an AJAX request. If you do not specify the option, the default is
`htmx.config.defaultSwapStyle` (`innerHTML`).

The possible values of this attribute are:

* `innerHTML` - Replace the inner html of the target element
* `outerHTML` - Replace the entire target element with the response
* `textContent` - Replace the text content of the target element, without parsing the response as HTML
* `beforebegin` - Insert the response before the target element
* `afterbegin` - Insert the response before the first child of the target element
* `beforeend` - Insert the response after the last child of the target element
* `afterend` - Insert the response after the target element
* `delete` - Deletes the target element regardless of the response
* `none`- Does not append content from response (out of band items will still be processed).

These options are based on standard DOM naming and the 
[`Element.insertAdjacentHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML)
specification.

So in this code:

```html
  <div hx-get="/example" hx-swap="afterend">Get Some HTML & Append It</div>
```

The `div` will issue a request to `/example` and append the returned content after the `div`

### Modifiers

The `hx-swap` attributes supports modifiers for changing the behavior of the swap.  They are outlined below.

#### Transition: `transition`

If you want to use the new [View Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) API
when a swap occurs, you can use the `transition:true` option for your swap.  You can also enable this feature globally by
setting the `htmx.config.globalViewTransitions` config setting to `true`.

#### Timing: `swap` & `settle`

You can modify the amount of time that htmx will wait after receiving a response to swap the content
by including a `swap` modifier:

```html
  <!-- this will wait 1s before doing the swap after it is received -->
  <div hx-get="/example" hx-swap="innerHTML swap:1s">Get Some HTML & Append It</div>
```

Similarly, you can modify the time between the swap and the settle logic by including a `settle`
modifier:

```html
  <!-- this will wait 1s before doing the settle after it is received -->
  <div hx-get="/example" hx-swap="innerHTML settle:1s">Get Some HTML & Append It</div>
```

These attributes can be used to synchronize htmx with the timing of CSS transition effects.

#### Title: `ignoreTitle`

By default, htmx will update the title of the page if it finds a `<title>` tag in the response content.  You can turn
off this behavior by setting the `ignoreTitle` option to true.

#### Scrolling: `scroll` & `show`

You can also change the scrolling behavior of the target element by using the `scroll` and `show` modifiers, both
of which take the values `top` and `bottom`:

```html
  <!-- this fixed-height div will scroll to the bottom of the div after content is appended -->
  <div style="height:200px; overflow: scroll" 
       hx-get="/example" 
       hx-swap="beforeend scroll:bottom">
     Get Some HTML & Append It & Scroll To Bottom
  </div>
```

```html
  <!-- this will get some content and add it to #another-div, then ensure that the top of #another-div is visible in the 
       viewport -->
  <div hx-get="/example" 
       hx-swap="innerHTML show:top"
       hx-target="#another-div">
    Get Some Content
  </div>
```

If you wish to target a different element for scrolling or showing, you may place a CSS selector after the `scroll:`
or `show:`, followed by `:top` or `:bottom`:

```html
  <!-- this will get some content and swap it into the current div, then ensure that the top of #another-div is visible in the 
       viewport -->
  <div hx-get="/example" 
       hx-swap="innerHTML show:#another-div:top">
    Get Some Content
  </div>
```

You may also use `window:top` and `window:bottom` to scroll to the top and bottom of the current window.


```html
  <!-- this will get some content and swap it into the current div, then ensure that the viewport is scrolled to the
       very top -->
  <div hx-get="/example" 
       hx-swap="innerHTML show:window:top">
    Get Some Content
  </div>
```

For boosted links and forms the default behaviour is `show:top`. You can disable it globally with
[htmx.config.scrollIntoViewOnBoost](@/api.md#config) or you can use `hx-swap="show:none"` on an element basis.

```html
<form action="/example" hx-swap="show:none">
  ...
</form>
```

#### Focus scroll

htmx preserves focus between requests for inputs that have a defined id attribute. By default htmx prevents auto-scrolling to focused inputs between requests which can be unwanted behavior on longer requests when the user has already scrolled away. To enable focus scroll you can use `focus-scroll:true`.

```html
  <input id="name" hx-get="/validation" 
       hx-swap="outerHTML focus-scroll:true"/>
```

Alternatively, if you want the page to automatically scroll to the focused element after each request you can change the htmx global configuration value `htmx.config.defaultFocusScroll` to true. Then disable it for specific requests using `focus-scroll:false`.

```html
  <input id="name" hx-get="/validation" 
       hx-swap="outerHTML focus-scroll:false"/>
```

## Notes

* `hx-swap` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element
* The default value of this attribute is `innerHTML`
* Due to DOM limitations, itâ€™s not possible to use the `outerHTML` method on the `<body>` element.
  htmx will change `outerHTML` on `<body>` to use `innerHTML`.
* The default swap delay is 0ms
* The default settle delay is 20ms
