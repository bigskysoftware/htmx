+++

The `hx-push-url` attribute allows you to push a URL into the browser [location history](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API).
This creates a new history entry, allowing navigation with the browserâ€™s back and forward buttons.
htmx snapshots the current DOM and saves it into its history cache, and restores from this cache on navigation.

The possible values of this attribute are:

1. `true`, which pushes the fetched URL into history.
2. `false`, which disables pushing the fetched URL if it would otherwise be pushed due to inheritance or [`hx-boost`](/attributes/hx-boost).
3. A URL to be pushed into the location bar.
   This may be relative or absolute, as per [`history.pushState()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState).

Here is an example:

```html
<div hx-get="/account" hx-push-url="true">
  Go to My Account
</div>
```

This will cause htmx to snapshot the current DOM to `localStorage` and push the URL `/account' into the browser location bar.

Another example:

```html
<div hx-get="/account" hx-push-url="/account/home">
  Go to My Account
</div>
```

This will push the URL `/account/home' into the location history.

## Notes

* `hx-push-url` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element
* The [`HX-Push-Url` response header](@/headers/hx-push-url.md) has similar behavior and can override this attribute.
* The [`hx-history-elt` attribute](@/attributes/hx-history-elt.md) allows changing which element is saved in the history cache.
