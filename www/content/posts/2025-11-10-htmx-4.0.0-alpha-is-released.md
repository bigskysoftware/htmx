## htmx 4.0.0-alpha2 Release

Happy to announce the first not-totally-embarrassing release of htmx 4.0: 4.0.0-alpha2

We are now using htmx 4.0 on the https://four.htmx.org/ website and are starting to shake out bugs and missing 
functionality.

I'm happy to report that as we've made progress, htmx 4.0 has come much closer to htmx 2.0 in terms of functionality.  
In fact, besides events and some JavaScript API changes, you can revert htmx 4.0 to  htmx 2.0 like behavior with 
two configuration options:

```js
htmx.config.implicitInheritance = true
htmx.config.noSwap = [204, 304, '4xx', '5xx']
```

I have also softened the language significantly on https://htmx.org/essays/the-fetchening/, with htmx 4.0 switching the 
_default_ from implicit to explicit inheritance, rather than removing implicit inheritance entirely.  (Turns out a lot 
of people liked the implicit approach, and it was easy to support in htmx 4.0!)

We are still going to be providing an upgrade extension that you can run in htmx 4.0 while in htmx 2.0 compatibility 
mode that will tell you everywhere you need to switch to explicit inheritance, that should be in the next release.

Timeline-wise, we probably have two or three more alphas ahead of us, we are shooting for a beta in mid-to-late 
December.  

This is a much more functional release (lol, it actually kind of works) so you can start playing around with it.

You can see an overview of changes here:

Enjoy!
